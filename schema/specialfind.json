Programming is needed to process the csv file before database load - the processing would create new geometry fields that are Well Known Text representations of each unique set of points (opening, closing, other).  Also need to add foreign keys. Also, there are fields I am abandoning in the CSV that we may want such as Residue Analysis and Origin and ACRcomment",
